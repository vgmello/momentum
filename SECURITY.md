## Supported Versions

We actively support the following versions with security updates:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 1.x.x   | :white_check_mark: |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability in Momentum, please report it to us responsibly.

### How to Report

1. **DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities
2. Email security reports to: [security contact - update with actual email]
3. Include the following information:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce the issue
   - Potential impact assessment
   - Any suggested fixes or mitigations

### Response Timeline

- **Initial Response**: Within 24-48 hours of receiving your report
- **Status Update**: Weekly updates on progress
- **Resolution**: We aim to resolve critical vulnerabilities within 7-14 days

### Disclosure Policy

- We will acknowledge receipt of your vulnerability report
- We will provide regular updates on our progress
- We will credit you in our security advisory (unless you prefer to remain anonymous)
- We follow responsible disclosure practices and will coordinate public disclosure timing with you

## Security Best Practices

### For Template Users

When using the Momentum template to create your applications:

#### Configuration Security
- **Never commit secrets** to version control
- Use environment variables or secure configuration providers for sensitive data
- Regularly rotate API keys, database credentials, and other secrets
- Use Azure Key Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, or similar services in production

#### Database Security
- Use parameterized queries (already implemented via Dapper)
- Regularly update database credentials
- Enable database encryption at rest and in transit
- Implement proper database access controls and least privilege principles

#### API Security
- Enable HTTPS in production (configured by default)
- Implement proper authentication and authorization
- Use rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Validate all input data
- Implement proper CORS policies

#### Container Security
- Regularly update base Docker images
- Scan container images for vulnerabilities
- Use non-root users in containers where possible
- Implement proper network segmentation

#### Kafka Security
- Use SSL/TLS for Kafka communications
- Implement proper authentication (SASL/SCRAM or mTLS)
- Use ACLs to control topic access
- Encrypt sensitive message payloads

#### Orleans Security
- Secure Orleans cluster communication with TLS
- Implement proper grain authorization
- Monitor grain activity for suspicious patterns

### For Template Contributors

#### Code Security
- Follow secure coding practices
- Use static analysis tools (already configured)
- Implement input validation for all template parameters
- Avoid hardcoded credentials or secrets in template code

#### Dependency Management
- Regularly update NuGet packages
- Monitor for security advisories
- Use tools like `dotnet list package --vulnerable`
- Pin dependency versions for reproducible builds

#### Template Security
- Validate template parameters for injection attacks
- Ensure generated code follows security best practices
- Review conditional compilation blocks for security implications
- Test template generation with malicious inputs

## Security Features

### Built-in Security Features

The Momentum template includes several security features by default:

#### Authentication & Authorization
- JWT token support configured
- Role-based authorization framework
- Configurable authentication schemes

#### Input Validation
- FluentValidation integration
- Model binding validation
- Custom validation attributes

#### Logging & Monitoring
- OpenTelemetry integration for security monitoring
- Structured logging with security event tracking
- Health checks for security components

#### Database Security
- Parameterized queries via Dapper
- Connection string encryption support
- Database migration security

#### API Security
- CORS configuration
- Request/response logging
- Rate limiting middleware support

### Security Headers
Default security headers are configured including:
- Content Security Policy (CSP)
- X-Content-Type-Options
- X-Frame-Options
- Strict-Transport-Security

## Vulnerability Management

### Known Security Considerations

1. **Template Parameters**: While template parameters are validated, always review generated code before deployment
2. **Development Secrets**: The template includes development certificates and keys that MUST be replaced in production
3. **Default Configurations**: Review all default configurations and harden them for production use
4. **Container Images**: Base images should be regularly updated for security patches

### Security Testing

We recommend implementing:
- Regular dependency vulnerability scans
- Static Application Security Testing (SAST)
- Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST)
- Container image vulnerability scanning
- Infrastructure security audits

## Incident Response

### Security Incident Classifications

- **Critical**: Immediate threat to production systems or user data
- **High**: Significant security vulnerability with workaround available
- **Medium**: Security issue with limited impact or difficult exploitation
- **Low**: Minor security improvement or hardening opportunity

### Response Process

1. **Detection**: Identify and verify the security incident
2. **Containment**: Implement immediate mitigations
3. **Investigation**: Analyze the root cause and impact
4. **Resolution**: Develop and deploy permanent fixes
5. **Recovery**: Restore normal operations
6. **Lessons Learned**: Document and improve processes
