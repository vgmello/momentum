# Wolverine Setup Detailed Configuration Guide

## Overview

This method configures Wolverine with enterprise-grade messaging capabilities:

- Registers a keyed PostgreSQL data source for durable message persistence
- Configures Wolverine with CQRS patterns and reliable messaging defaults
- Integrates with OpenTelemetry for distributed tracing and performance monitoring
- Sets up automatic validation, exception handling, and transaction management
- Enables CloudEvent support for standardized cross-service communication
- Provides health checks for messaging infrastructure monitoring
- Skips registration if SkipServiceRegistration is true (for testing scenarios)

The messaging system supports both synchronous request/response patterns and asynchronous event-driven architectures, making it suitable for complex business workflows.

## Key Features

### Message Persistence

Wolverine is configured with PostgreSQL for durable message storage, ensuring message delivery guarantees and supporting inbox/outbox patterns for transactional consistency.

### CQRS Support

Built-in support for Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) patterns with automatic command and query handler discovery and registration.

### Observability Integration

Full integration with OpenTelemetry for:
- Distributed tracing across message flows
- Performance metrics for message processing
- Health monitoring of messaging infrastructure

### Validation and Error Handling

Automatic integration with FluentValidation for command validation, with configurable error handling policies and dead letter queue support.

### CloudEvents Support

Standardized message formatting using CloudEvents specification for interoperability with external systems and services.

### Health Monitoring

Comprehensive health checks for messaging infrastructure components including database connectivity and message queue health.

## Configuration Patterns

### Basic Configuration

The AddWolverine() method provides sensible defaults for most messaging scenarios while allowing customization through the configure action parameter.

### Advanced Routing

Support for complex message routing patterns including:
- Topic-based routing for event publishing
- Queue-based routing for command processing
- Conditional routing based on message content
- Dead letter handling for failed messages

### Transaction Management

Automatic transaction management with support for:
- Transactional inbox patterns
- Transactional outbox patterns
- Saga pattern implementation
- Compensating actions for rollbacks
