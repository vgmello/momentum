# Service Defaults Detailed Configuration Guide

## Overview

This method configures essential infrastructure for microservices including:

- HTTPS configuration for Kestrel with secure communication
- Structured logging with Serilog and OpenTelemetry integration
- Distributed tracing and metrics collection via OpenTelemetry
- Wolverine messaging framework with PostgreSQL persistence
- FluentValidation validators discovery from domain assemblies
- Health checks with multiple endpoints for liveness/readiness probes
- Service discovery for container orchestration environments
- HTTP client resilience with circuit breakers and retry policies

This method is designed to be the single entry point for configuring a production-ready service with observability, resilience, and messaging capabilities required for cloud-native microservices architectures.

## Configuration Features

### Infrastructure Components

- **HTTPS and Security**: Automatic HTTPS configuration with proper certificate handling
- **Logging**: Structured logging with Serilog, including request correlation and performance tracking
- **Observability**: OpenTelemetry integration for metrics, traces, and distributed monitoring
- **Messaging**: Wolverine framework with PostgreSQL for reliable message processing
- **Validation**: Automatic discovery and registration of FluentValidation validators
- **Health Checks**: Comprehensive health monitoring for infrastructure dependencies
- **Resilience**: HTTP client policies with circuit breakers, retries, and timeouts

### Production Readiness

The service defaults are designed for production deployment with:

- Container orchestration compatibility (Kubernetes, Docker Swarm)
- Cloud-native patterns and best practices
- Automatic service discovery and registration
- Performance monitoring and alerting capabilities
- Fault tolerance and graceful degradation
- Security headers and HTTPS enforcement

## Usage Patterns

### Basic Setup

The AddServiceDefaults() method provides a one-line configuration for most microservice scenarios, reducing boilerplate code while ensuring production-grade infrastructure.

### Advanced Configuration

For specific business requirements, the method can be combined with additional configuration for custom messaging routes, specialized health checks, or domain-specific observability.
