## Code Examples

### Command Definition and Handler

```csharp
// Commands/CreateUser.cs
public record CreateUserCommand(Guid TenantId, string Name, string Email) : ICommand<Result<User>>;

public class CreateUserValidator : AbstractValidator<CreateUserCommand>
{
    public CreateUserValidator()
    {
        RuleFor(x => x.TenantId).NotEmpty();
        RuleFor(x => x.Name).NotEmpty().MaximumLength(100);
        RuleFor(x => x.Email).NotEmpty().EmailAddress();
    }
}

public static class CreateUserCommandHandler
{
    public record DbCommand(Data.Entities.User User) : ICommand<Data.Entities.User>;

    public static async Task<(Result<User>, UserCreated?)> Handle(
        CreateUserCommand command,
        IMessageBus messaging,
        CancellationToken cancellationToken)
    {
        var dbCommand = CreateInsertCommand(command);
        var insertedUser = await messaging.InvokeCommandAsync(dbCommand, cancellationToken);

        var result = insertedUser.ToModel();
        var createdEvent = new UserCreated(result.TenantId, result);

        return (result, createdEvent);
    }

    public static async Task<Data.Entities.User> Handle(DbCommand command, AppDb db, CancellationToken cancellationToken)
    {
        return await db.Users.InsertWithOutputAsync(command.User, token: cancellationToken);
    }

    private static DbCommand CreateInsertCommand(CreateUserCommand command) =>
        new(new Data.Entities.User
        {
            TenantId = command.TenantId,
            UserId = Guid.CreateVersion7(),
            Name = command.Name,
            Email = command.Email,
            CreatedDateUtc = DateTime.UtcNow,
            UpdatedDateUtc = DateTime.UtcNow
        });
}
```

### Query Definition and Handler

```csharp
// Queries/GetUser.cs
public record GetUserQuery(Guid Id) : IQuery<Result<User>>;

public static class GetUserQueryHandler
{
    public static async Task<Result<User>> Handle(
        GetUserQuery query, 
        AppDb db, 
        CancellationToken cancellationToken)
    {
        var user = await db.Users
            .FirstOrDefaultAsync(u => u.Id == query.Id, cancellationToken);

        if (user is not null)
        {
            return user.ToModel(); // Success
        }

        return new List<ValidationFailure> { new("Id", "User not found") }; // Error
    }
}
```

### Integration Event

```csharp
// Contracts/IntegrationEvents/UserCreated.cs
using Momentum.ServiceDefaults.Messaging;

/// <summary>
/// Published when a new user is successfully created in the system.
/// This event notifies other services that a user account is available.
/// </summary>
[EventTopic<User>]
public record UserCreated(
    [PartitionKey] Guid TenantId,
    User User
);
```
